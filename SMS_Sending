# This script sends an SMS message using the Vonage API (formerly Nexmo).
# You need a valid Vonage account, API key, and secret.
# Replace <key>, <secret>, and <phone> with your actual credentials and recipient's number.
# The message will be sent from the "from" name you define.
# The script includes error handling and prints whether the message was sent successfully.
#  Make sure to replace:
#  "<your_api_key>" and "<your_api_secret>" with your Vonage API credentials
#  "<recipient_phone_number>" with a valid number (e.g. "905xxxxxxxxx" for Turkey)
